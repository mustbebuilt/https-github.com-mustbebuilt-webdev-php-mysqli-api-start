# Example Project Using API Calls to Load Data

This repo acts as a tutorial for working with APIs to retrieve data.  The API endpoints are built using PHP/MySQL via mysqli to run queries against a database and extract the results as JSON data.

Then the endpoints are called via Javascript's `fetch` method and added to the DOM of the appropriate HTML files.
